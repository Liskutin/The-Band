<p>The project is a result of me self-learning web development (front so far). It consists of HTML and CSS and uses Bootstrap.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: This project was intended as a learning exercise and therefore fallows steps of Kevin Powell&#39;s youtube series. I twiked things
I did not like or did not work (bootstrap 3 vs 4 mostly) - though was not mare mirroring but series was used as a tool to see what I did wrong  - 
faster than posting on StackOverflow.</p>
<p>Used: BootStrap, Prepros (sass), HTML&amp;CSS.</p>
<p>Future plans: Plan to do more once I progress further with my learning - javascript etc. Also once I am there plan to change navbar to have scrol
effect and perhaps expand the project for additional pages (albums) - music. </p>
<p>KNOWN ISSUES: In some instances, GitHub Pages load my heading font &quot;banshee-std&quot; incorrectly. </p>
