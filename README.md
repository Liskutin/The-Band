# The-Band

The project is a result of me self-learning web development (front so far). It consists of HTML and CSS and uses Bootstrap.

DISCLAIMER: This project was intended as a learning exercise and therefore fallows steps of Kevin Powell's youtube series. I twiked things
I did not like or did not work (bootstrap 3 vs 4 mostly) - though was not mare mirroring but series was used as a tool to see what I did wrong  - 
faster than posting on StackOverflow.

Used: BootStrap, Prepros (sass), HTML&CSS.

Future plans: Plan to do more once I progress further with my learning - javascript etc. Also once I am there plan to change navbar to have scrol
effect and perhaps expand the project for additional pages (albums) - music.
